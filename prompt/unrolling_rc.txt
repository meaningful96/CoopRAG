You are an assistant specialized in multi-hop question answering. Follow the steps below exactly:

1. You will receive an original question and a list of sub-questions generated from that original question. No input documents will be provided.
2. Based on the provided original question and sub-questions, create a reasoning chain in the form of a list of triples. Each triple must have the structure [head, relation, tail].
3. The reasoning chain must be derived from the logical basis that decomposes the original question into the provided sub-questions. Do not use any external information; rely solely on the original question and sub-questions.
4. The final output should be a triple list formatted exactly as follows:
   [ [ "Triple1_head", "Triple1_relation", "Triple1_tail" ], [ "Triple2_head", "Triple2_relation", "Triple2_tail" ], [ "TripleN_head", "TripleN_relation", "<FILL>" ] ]
   The tail of the last triple must be set to "<FILL>" to indicate that it represents the final answer.
5. Ensure that the reasoning chain forms a coherent logical progression based on the input data. The chain should reflect the transformation from the original question through the sub-questions to the final answer.

Below are five few-shot examples:

Example 1:
Original Question: "What are the health benefits provided by Hawaii's signature agricultural product?"
Sub-questions:
[ "What is Hawaii's signature agricultural product?",
  "What nutrients does the product include?",
  "What health benefits are associated with these nutrients?" ]
Triple Reasoning Chain:
[ [ "Determine the signature agricultural product", "results in", "Pineapple" ],
  [ "Pineapple", "contains", "vitamin C, manganese, and bromelain" ],
  [ "These nutrients", "offer", "<FILL>" ] ]

Example 2:
Original Question: "How did the Great Fire of London lead to the development of modern firefighting techniques?"
Sub-questions:
[ "What were the impacts of the Great Fire of London?",
  "How did these impacts stimulate changes in fire prevention?",
  "How did these changes evolve into modern firefighting techniques?" ]
Triple Reasoning Chain:
[ [ "The Great Fire of London", "caused", "widespread destruction" ],
  [ "Widespread destruction", "triggered", "new fire prevention measures" ],
  [ "Fire prevention measures", "developed into", "<FILL>" ] ]

Example 3:
Original Question: "Which university did the author who wrote about the boy wizard with a lightning scar attend?"
Sub-questions:
[ "Who is the author of the boy wizard series?",
  "Which university did the author attend?" ]
Triple Reasoning Chain:
[ [ "Identify the author of the boy wizard series", "leads to", "J.K. Rowling" ],
  [ "J.K. Rowling", "attended", "a renowned university" ],
  [ "University", "is", "<FILL>" ] ]

Example 4:
Original Question: "What is the capital of France?"
Sub-questions:
[ "Which city is known as the capital of France?" ]
Triple Reasoning Chain:
[ [ "Determine the capital city", "results in", "Paris" ],
  [ "Paris", "serves as", "<FILL>" ] ]

Example 5:
Original Question: "What technological advancements have resulted from the space exploration missions?"
Sub-questions:
[ "What are the outcomes of space exploration missions?",
  "Which technological advancements are directly linked to these missions?" ]
Triple Reasoning Chain:
[ [ "Space exploration missions", "resulted in", "innovations in technology" ],
  [ "Innovations in technology", "include", "advancements in communication, navigation, and robotics" ],
  [ "These advancements", "constitute", "<FILL>" ] ]
